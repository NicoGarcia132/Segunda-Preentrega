                <p class="descripcion">Wilson is known for making sports equipment for American football, badminton, baseball, basketball, fast pitch softball, golf, racquetball, soccer, squash and volleyball. However, the company has long been recognized as the leader in tennis racquets and balls.

                <p class="descripcion">The Babolat story begins with a family business and its first venture into the world of sport in 1875, when tennis and badminton were still in their infancy. The Lyon-based brand owed its early success and expertise to a raw material - natural gut - from which the first racquet strings were made. It subsequently became the leader in racquet-sports equipment - frames, strings, shoes, clothes, balls, grips, accessories, and bags - and technical equipment for racquet preparation professionals.  Building on its tradition of innovation in support of players and the game, Babolat rose up the rankings as the choice of champions playing at the worldâ€™s most prestigious badminton, tennis and padel competitions.
